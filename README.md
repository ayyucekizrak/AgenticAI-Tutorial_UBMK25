# AgenticAI Tutorial [UBMK25](https://ubmk.org.tr/)
10th International Conference of Computer Sciences and Engineering

10. Uluslararası Bilgi​sayar Bilimleri ve Mühendisliği ​Konferansı


## Overview
This tutorial introduces participants to the evolution of large language models (LLMs), starting from their fundamental principles and progressing toward **agentic systems**. Participants will learn about model training, prompt engineering, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and tool integration, as well as agentic LM design patterns such as planning, reflection, and multi-agent collaboration.  

The tutorial concludes with the development of a **News Agent** application, allowing participants to consolidate their theoretical knowledge with hands-on implementation.

## Tutorial Outline  

**This tutorial covers:**  
- Fundamentals of language models and their training  
- Applications of LLMs in practice (APIs, coding assistants, copilots)  
- Prompt engineering strategies (clear instructions, few-shot, CoT reasoning)  
- Common limitations of LLMs (hallucination, context length, attribution)  
- Enhancing model capabilities with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
- **Tool usage**: API calls, code execution, real-time information integration  
- Transitioning from LMs to **Agentic LMs** with key design patterns:  
  - Planning  
  - Reflection  
  - Tool usage  
  - Multi-agent collaboration  
- Real-world applications: software development, research, automation  
- **Hands-on project: building a News Agent**

## AI Agents - Practical

### [NewsAgent](https://github.com/ayyucekizrak/AgenticAI-Tutorial_UBMK25/blob/main/news_agent.ipynb)

Searches for recent news on a given topic, fetches article content, and generates a concise markdown brief with 3 key points and sources.
Uses DuckDuckGo for news search and AI agent for content analysis.
